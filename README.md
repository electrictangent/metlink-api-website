# Metlink API website
This is a web app that is based on the Metlink API. The aim of this project is to create a better version of the website https://metlink.org.nz based on the Metlink API at https://opendata.metlink.org.nz

Some limitations with the API - there are (supposed) to be request limits which could become a problem if the web app gets a substantial amount of traffic.
